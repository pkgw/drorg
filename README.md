Organize documents on Google Drive efficiently.

This tool is only for highly motivated users at the moment. In particular, you
canâ€™t use it without registering a Google Cloud Application for OAuth2
authentication, enabling it to use the Google Drive v3 and Google Persion
Services v1 APIs, and then saving the resulting JSON credential in a special
file to be used by the tool. That process is not yet documented.
